            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To this end he cloathed himſelf with our <hi>nature,</hi> and became obedient, not only in a way of <hi>action</hi> to the whole <hi>Law</hi> of God, but in a way of <hi>ſuffering</hi> too; for <hi>he humbled himſelf to the death of the Croſs,</hi> that ſuffering in the fleſh, he might <hi>ſatisfie</hi> Gods <hi>juſtice,</hi> and <hi>purchaſe</hi> a <hi>people</hi> to himſelf by the <hi>price</hi> of his own deareſt blood; and as many as will heartily <hi>ſubmit</hi> to him, and <hi>faithfully</hi> believe in him, ſhall be endued with his <hi>Spirit;</hi> and finally, <hi>inherit</hi> Eternal Life in his Kingdom.</p>

And beſides, God doth freely enter into Bond unto his Creatures, as well by giving them a Law, as by making them a promiſe; for if he preſcribes a Law, he is (in his own natural equity) bound to beſtow grace and aſſiſtance neceſſary to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it; and if he promiſeth a thing <hi>abſolutely,</hi> he ought <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi> to perform it; if he promiſeth a thing <hi>conditionally,</hi> the

                     <p>The tenour of your Diſcourſe hath led me to look upon [<hi>Faith</hi>] or which is all one [<hi>Believing</hi>] under this noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; viz. <hi>A laying hold upon Chriſt the Mediatour, as the means to help us out of ſin and miſery;</hi> and if it be ſo, I am apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That as <hi>Adam</hi> had no <hi>need,</hi> ſo neither had he <hi>power,</hi> (though he had ſo much as was ſutable to his condition) in his <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>integrity</hi> to <hi>lay</hi> hold on Chriſt: And if I apprehend your ſenſe aright, <hi>Faith</hi> contains, or implies a power to <hi>ariſe</hi> after our <hi>fall:</hi> If therefore <hi>Adam</hi> before his <hi>fall</hi> had this <hi>power;</hi> then after he was fall'n, he might have <hi>elicited,</hi> or drawn it forth to his <hi>reſtitution;</hi> and ſo there ſhould have been no need of that

                        <hi>omnipotent</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> operation of God unto <hi>this</hi> work, which for <hi>mightineſs,</hi> is not <hi>inferiour</hi> to the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, or <hi>raiſing</hi> up the <hi>dead,</hi> as is pretended. Beſides, the queſtion is not concerning the Hiſtorical Belief of a Mediatour, in caſe God had made the Revelation upon ſuppoſition of the fall (as he did not) but whether <hi>Adam</hi> had a power to believe in Chriſt ſavingly? This he could not do, becauſe ſaving faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a renouncing of ones own works, and a relying upon Chriſts merits and mediation for grace and pardon. This in the ſtate of Innocency <hi>Adam</hi> could not do, becauſe God had given him a command, and tyed him in a Covenant to do otherwiſe: And I obſerve, that the Son of God hath <hi>ſealed</hi> a new <hi>Covenant</hi> for Mankind with his <hi>own</hi> blood; and he invites <hi>all</hi> men to ſubſcribe it. Now this is called, I perceive, a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> but as it is eſtabliſhed upon <hi>better</hi> promiſes than the former; ſo I find that more <hi>dreadful</hi> threatnings are annexed to it alſo.

                     <p>Why, what is it you ſtumble at? All the learned confeſs, that it is in the power of God to annihilate the holieſt Angel in heaven, and that in the execution hereof, he ſhould execute no other than a lawful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and as he is Lord of life and death (though not as a Judge) they conclude he hath power to inflict any pain upon the creature, be he never ſo innocent.</p>

                     <p>To annihilate is one thing, to impoſe torments another; where there is no deſert, God no doubt may take away what he hath given without injuſtice: If in taking away his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures life, he inſlicts a pain that is finite, not exceeding thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of life it hath enjoyed, who doubts of the equity of ſuch proceedings? But to inflict everlaſting torments in hell-fire, in proportion ſo much above all the good either confer'd upon the Creature, or made poſſible to it, is (to ſay no worſe) a ſeverity too extream to be attributed to a good God: And if your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be ſuch (as I think they are) that according to them, the deſign of the whole Affair, muſt be finally reſolved into his meer pleaſure, to ſet for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </note> is drawn from <hi>Bradwardine</hi>'s Demonſtration, that no will of God is <hi>conditional,</hi> but <hi>abſolute</hi> throughout. The Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is this; if there be any conditional will in God, the condition of that will of God is either willed by God or no. If not willed by him, then that muſt be acknowledged to come to paſs in the World without the will of God, which he holds for a great abſurdity; but if that condition be alſo in ſome ſort willed by God, then either <hi>abſolutely</hi> or <hi>conditionally;</hi> if <hi>abſolutely,</hi> then alſo the thing <hi>conditionated,</hi> ſhall be abſolutely willed by God. As for example; if God doth will that a man ſhall be ſaved, in caſe he <hi>believe,</hi> and withall doth <hi>abſolutely</hi> reſolve to give him <hi>Faith,</hi> and make him believe, this is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

                           <hi>abſolutely</hi> to reſolve to ſave him: But if it be ſaid, that the condition ſpoken of, is willed by God, not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but <hi>conditionally;</hi> then a way is open to a progreſs <hi>in infinitum,</hi> which all diſclaim: For, as touching that ſecond condition, I will renew the former Argument, enquiring whether that be alſo willed at all by God, or no; and if it be, whether it be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led abſolutely or conditionally; ſo that either we muſt ſubſiſt in ſomething that is abſolutely willed by God; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, all that depend thereupon, as conditionated, ſhall in like manner be abſolutely willed by God; or a progreſs from one condition to another, and that without end, cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</q> This is Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> his demonſtration, taken from <hi>Bradwaraine;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>

                     <p>Sir, if you will receive what that Reverend Dr. holds forth in another place, you will underſtand his opinion more fully.

                     <p>Here are ſo many infirmities in this piece of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that it will be a trouble to repeat them. (1.)

You would inſinuate that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies his grace only to ſuch as provoke him by their neglect of the means; Whereas Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> ſaith, he determined the denial of it, for his meere pleaſure, without any conſideration of any thing done by man. So that a man may be very diligent in the uſe of means, and yet faile of the grace of God, meerly becauſe it is not Gods pleaſure to give it him. (3.) You informe us, that God will ſtand to his own Ordinances, becauſe of his own appointment; and for <hi>their</hi> honour, when he will give any man <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, he will work it by them. Is it worſe to abſent ones ſelf from thoſe Ordinances, then to preſent ones ſelf to them with <hi>an averſe and wicked mind?</hi> This (ſaith Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi>) cannot <hi>hinder</hi> Gods operation; and why ſhould that, eſpecially ſeeing (as you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply) God hath his <hi>extraordinary</hi> wayes to diſpenſe his grace, as well as ordinary?</p>

To come to your laſt, and maddeſt inſtance of all; I cannot allow it a wiſe courſe, for any man to ſet his houſe on fire, that he may gain a proof whether God hath (in that caſe) paſſ'd a Decree to ſave it from burning. I know God grants us no ſuch licenſe; and if we take it of our ſelves, 'tis a preſumption in us to dream, that he will prevent the miſchief that is like to enſue ſo groſs a folly. But in our caſe, the houſe was ſet on fire by our firſt <hi>Parents,</hi> many thouſands of years before we were born, and nothing but the blood of Chriſt is of ſufficient force to quench it. That your compariſon may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, we may frame it thus: Suppoſe all the houſes of your <hi>Town</hi> were ſet on fire, and God had <hi>abſolutely</hi> decreed that all but <hi>ſix</hi> ſhould be <hi>burnt</hi> to aſhes, and that the uſe of all means whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould be utterly uneffectual to their preſervation; nay, and for the preſervation of thoſe <hi>ſix</hi> too, till his <hi>Omnipotent</hi> power did determine thoſe your <hi>ſix</hi> Neighbours <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> to uſe that means, to extinguiſh the fire in thoſe their ſix houſes: If you ſhould proclaim this to your whole <hi>Town,</hi> as a truth, from the <hi>mouth</hi> of God, and <hi>they</hi> find grounds to believe you, How many, though you ſhould call never ſo earneſtly upon them, would be ſo <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly</hi> diligent, as to fetch their <hi>Ladders</hi> and <hi>Buckets,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to quench the flame?</p>

                     <p>Sir, I am able to tell you not only the <hi>man,</hi> but the very <hi>Text</hi> he preach'd upon, with the <hi>day</hi> and <hi>houre</hi> when I was <hi>effectually</hi> called.

N.</hi> as melted my heart and ſpirit into that <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>temper,</hi> that I ſhall never forget it. This <hi>Sermon</hi> was a preparation to the <hi>Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> and I was ſo fit for the impreſſion at that time, that I made no objection or ſcruple at it. And having upon this <hi>Call</hi> eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the [<hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> (though I ſay it) I have been true to it ever ſince, according to the ſeveral degrees of light which I have received. How conſtant I have been in frequenting publick and private meetings; How much I have contemned the World, and laid out my ſelf upon this account; nay, how much I have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for godlineſs in evil times, and in the ſharpeſt tryals never ſhrunk; theſe things are not ſo fit for me to relate, as for ſome of my Neighbours, that have been very well acquainted with them.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58106:106"/> aſſiſtance to my ſelf in this charitable enterprize, I deſire to renew my Diſcourſe with you, in order to your better ſatisfaction and comfort. And let me tell you, as the ground-work from Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> 
                        <q> That all the terrifying temptations which are grounded on miſrepreſentations of God (as if he were a cruel deſtroyer <note place="margin">Direct for peace of Conſc. Dir. 7. pag. 46.</note> to be fled from) are diſpelled by the due conſideration of his goodneſs, and the deep ſetled apprehenſions of his gracious, merciful, lovely nature (which indeed is the firſt work of true Religion, and the very Maſter-radical Act of true Grace, and the Maintainer of ſpiritual life and motion. If you think of God as one that ia glad of all advantages againſt you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth <note place="margin">Ib. pag. 18, 19.</note> in his Creatures miſery, it is impoſſible you ſhould love him. The love of our ſelves is ſo deeply rooted in nature, that we cannot lay it be, nor love any thing that is abſolutely and directly againſt us. We conceive of the Devil as an abſolute enemy to God and men, and one that ſeeks our deſtruction, and therefore we cannot love him: And the great cauſe why troubled ſouls do love God no more, is, becauſe they repreſent him to themſelves in an ugly odious ſhape. To think of God, as one that ſeeks and delighteth in mans ruine, is to make him as the Devil; and then what wonder, if inſtead of loving him, and delighting in him, you tremble at the thoughts of him, and flie from him! As I have obſerved Children, when they have ſeen the Divel painted on a Wall in an ugly ſhape, they have ſeen the Divel painted on a Wall in an ugly ſhape, they have partly feared, and partly hated it: If you do ſo by God in your fancy, it is not putting the Name of [<hi>God</hi>] on him when you have done, that will reconcile your affections to him, as long as you ſtrip him of his Divine Nature. Remember the Holy Ghoſts deſcription of God, 1 <hi>John 4. 16. God is love.</hi> Write theſe words deep in your underſtanding. </q>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. They hold, that all things come to paſs <hi>inevitably.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. They thought the reaſon of this <hi>inevitableneſſe</hi> of events to be an unchangeable <hi>connexion</hi> of <hi>natural</hi> cauſes.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Our Oppoſites ſtifly maintain the former of theſe <hi>Tenets.</hi> Now let the Reader obſerve, that the moſt <hi>prodigious</hi> abſurdities accompanying this <hi>Stoical</hi> error, follow the firſt part of their opinion, though ſequeſtred from the ſecond. For if all things come to paſs <hi>unavoidably,</hi> what need I care what I do? yea, if I ſhall care, I ſhall care whether I will or no; and a thouſand the like horrid conceits follow the opinion of the <hi>necesſity</hi> of events, whatſoever we make to be the <hi>cauſe</hi> of this neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>It is a great point of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Divinity at this day, that all things are done <hi>unavoidably,</hi> and they with our Oppoſites make Gods <hi>will</hi> to be the cauſe of this unavoidableneſs; and therefore they judge of <hi>Gods pleaſure</hi> or <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> by the <hi>event.</hi> Yet there is no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> but abhorreth this <hi>Turciſm,</hi> and gives it no better entertainment than <hi>Anathema Maranatha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its too apparent therefore, that albeit our Adverſaries are true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yet in this point their opinion is guilty by reaſon of its conſequence, both of <hi>Stoiciſm</hi> and <hi>Turciſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, if we conſider the ſecond part of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> opinion, we ſhall perceive, that the opinion which we confute cannot be minced, but that it will be compleat <hi>Stoiciſm.</hi> The <hi>Stoicks</hi> thought the <hi>connexion</hi> of cauſes to be the cauſe of the <hi>necesſity</hi> of <hi>events,</hi> its true; but what did they think to be the <hi>connexion</hi> of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58106:137"/> cauſes? doubtleſs the eternal Laws of <hi>Nature,</hi> which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a <hi>Deity.</hi> It is very probable they thought the <hi>Fates</hi> to be but <hi>Natures</hi> Laws, but whatſoever they meant by the <hi>Fates,</hi> its evident they made their <hi>decrees</hi> to be the cauſe of the <hi>connexion</hi> of cauſes. How often read we both in <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Poets</hi> of <hi>Fatorum Decreta, Parcarum Leges, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, the word <hi>Fatum</hi> it ſelf is as much as a <hi>Decree;</hi> as <hi>Edictum</hi> from <hi>Edicere,</hi> ſo <hi>Fatum</hi> from <hi>Fari.

Do not our Adverſaries in this point ſuppoſe an <hi>inviolable</hi> linking of all things together, one <hi>neceſſarily</hi> following in the neck of another? Do they not make the <hi>cauſe</hi> of this linking to be Gods irreſiſtable decree? Do they not defend compleat <hi>Stoiciſm?</hi> What part of <hi>Stoiciſm</hi> do they diſclaim? Do they not maintain <hi>inevitable</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, Do they not teach an <hi>indiſſoluble</hi> connexion of all things? Do they not believe divine <hi>decrees</hi> to be the <hi>cauſe</hi> of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion? Certainly they muſt needs confeſs themſelves <hi>Stoicks</hi> in this point, unleſs we will give them leave to grant the <hi>prezmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and deny the <hi>concluſion.</hi> I know the <hi>Stoicks</hi> had miſ-conceits concerning the <hi>Deities,</hi> (as accounting thoſe to be <hi>Deities</hi> which are not) whoſe <hi>decrees</hi> they made the <hi>cauſes</hi> of all things; but they were the common errors of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and are beſide the point in hand: And truly theſe ſet aſide, I ſee not wherein our Adverſaries differ from the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> I have proſecuted this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument more copiouſly, becauſe it includeth many others, I mean, all thoſe which Scripture or Reaſon furniſh us with, againſt the error of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and they are many; for I think verily, there are few opinions which have a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Of the laſt ſort I will ſpecific one in a ſecond Argument.</p>
                  <p>That opinion, which being admitted maketh God the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> is groſs and erroneous, that I may ſay no worſe, but ſo (I <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2.</note> ſpeak it with <hi>horror</hi>) doth the Opinion of our Oppoſites. I know they are renowned <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and as they abhor <hi>Stoical</hi> errors, ſo they hold this damnable doctrine, (which is worſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58106:138"/> than ever any <hi>Heretick</hi> held) which transformeth <hi>God</hi> into a <hi>Devil,</hi> to be moſt <hi>accurſed:</hi> yet ſo the caſe ſtandeth, that as the <note place="margin">See this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the 4th Objection.</note> error of <hi>fatal neceſsity,</hi> ſo this of the <hi>cauſe of ſin,</hi> fatally followeth their opinion; which I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>They teach, That nothing is done in the world, nor can be done, but what God hath <hi>decreed</hi> to be done. Now it's too cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that three quarters of the things which are done in the world are <hi>ſins,</hi> therefore according to this opinion, God is the <hi>principal</hi> cauſe of ſins, <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> are but His <hi>Inſtruments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſual Anſwer is, That God is the cauſe of all the <hi>actions</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Evaſio.</note> that are <hi>ſinful,</hi> but not of the <hi>ſirfulneſs</hi> of the actions; of all our <hi>works,</hi> but not of our <hi>obliquities</hi> and imperfections: As one that rides upon a halting Jade is the cauſe of his <hi>motion,</hi> and yet not of his <hi>halting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its a hard caſe when they have but one <hi>frivolous</hi> diſtinction to keep God from <hi>ſinning:</hi> Might I here (without wandring) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <note place="margin">Confutatio.</note> of the nature of ſin, I could prove <hi>ſin</hi> it ſelf to be an <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and confute this groundleſs diſtinction that way; but I will keep my ſelf as much to the purpoſe as I can, and ſo anſwer it thus, or rather confute it.</p>
                  <p>That which is a <hi>principal</hi> cauſe of any action, is a cauſe of thoſe <hi>events</hi> which accompany that action <hi>neceſſarily.</hi> This Rule is moſt certainly true. Therefore if God by His decrees do force <note place="margin">Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</note> us to thoſe actions which cannot be done without ſin, God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (I am afraid to rehearſe it) muſt needs be guilty of ſin. For example. If God decreed that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould <hi>unavoidably</hi> eat the <hi>forbidden</hi> fruit, ſeeing the <hi>eating</hi> of the fruit which he had <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi> muſt needs be with a groſs <hi>obliquity;</hi> I do not ſee how this diſtinction will juſtifie God: for <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned becauſe he <hi>ate</hi> the fruit that was forbidden; but they ſay, God <hi>decreed</hi> that he ſhould eat the fruit which was forbidden, <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably.</hi> The concluſion is too <hi>blaſphemous</hi> to be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may ſee how well that common diſtinction holdeth water; yea, if this <hi>nicety</hi> were ſound, man himſelf might prove, that he committed no <hi>murder</hi> though he <hi>ſtabbed</hi> the dead party to the heart; for at his arraignment he might tell the <hi>Judge,</hi> that he did indeed thruſt his <hi>dagger</hi> into his heart, but it was not that which took away his life, but the <hi>extinction</hi> of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58106:138"/> 
                     <hi>natural</hi> heat and <hi>vital</hi> ſpirits. Who ſeeth not the wild <hi>frenzie</hi> of him who ſhould make this <hi>Apology,</hi> yet this is all our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſay for God. They ſay, His <hi>decree</hi> was the <hi>cauſe</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> took the <hi>fruit,</hi> and put it into his mouth, and ate that which he had commanded he ſhould not eat. Yet they ſay, He was not the cauſe of the tranſgreſſion of the commandment.</p>
                  <p>The example of the <hi>halting</hi> Jade is a meer <hi>impertinency;</hi> for ſuppoſe it were (as it is not) appliable to us, who halt <hi>naturally;</hi> yet <hi>Adam,</hi> before this action, was <hi>ſound;</hi> and therefore God <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesſitating</hi> him to ſuch an inconveniency, dealt with him as if one ſhould drive a <hi>luſty Nag</hi> into rough paſſages, where he muſt needs break his leggs. Neither is it (as I ſaid) appliable unto us the <hi>lame</hi> poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> for he who rideth an horſe that was <hi>lame</hi> before, although he be not a cauſe of the <hi>impotency</hi> which he findeth in the horſe already, yet in urging him to motion, he is now a <hi>cauſe</hi> of the <hi>actual</hi> imperfection in the motion, and ſo perhaps a cauſe of encreaſing the impotency for the future, though he were not the cauſe of his lameneſs, yet he is of his limping at that time. Let the horſe ſtand ſtill, and ſee whether he will halt or no. Marry if the horſe go of himſelf, then the <hi>Rider</hi> is no cauſe of his halting, and ſo we may ſay, that all our <hi>haltings</hi> are from our ſelves without any <hi>instigation</hi> from God.</p>
                  <p>I know our Oppoſites have another ſhift, teaching, that God uſeth to <hi>puniſh</hi> one ſin by making us to <hi>commit</hi> another; ſo that although we <hi>ſin,</hi> He doth but <hi>puniſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Albeit I do not believe this to be true, as 'tis commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, yet I abſtain at this time from a farther examination of it, becauſe it weakens not my Argument about <hi>Adam;</hi> for his ſin was the firſt that ever he committed, and the <hi>original</hi> of all that ever followed; and therefore if Gods <hi>decree</hi> were the <hi>cauſe</hi> that he <hi>ate</hi> the <hi>forbidden</hi> fruit, as our Adverſaries teach, its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent whom they make the <hi>Author of all ſin.</hi> Theſe two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments well ſcanned, are ſufficient to make any (not fore-ſtalled with pre-conceits) to be afraid of that opinion which believeth all things to come to paſs <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> by reaſon of Gods <hi>irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> decree, and therefore they ſhall ſuffice for the confutation of it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſeeing it is clogged with ſuch <hi>monſtrous</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,

                  <p>Now I proceed to the confirmation of our opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>contingency</hi> of ſome <hi>events</hi> in reſpect of God, by two Arguments more.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, That God hath decreed that all his creatures <hi>ordinarily,</hi> and for the moſt part, ſhould work according to their <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1.</note> ſeveral <hi>kinds</hi> and <hi>endowments,</hi> by which he in the Creation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed them: For illuſtration they may be ranked into <hi>three</hi> ſeveral forms.</p>
                  <p>In the loweſt ſtand the meer <hi>natural</hi> Agents, <hi>inanimate</hi> and <hi>ſenſleſs</hi> creatures; to theſe God hath given certain <hi>inſtincts</hi> and <note place="margin" type="runSum">1.</note> 
                     <hi>inclinations,</hi> by which they are <hi>determinately</hi> ſwayed to theſe or theſe certain <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>operations,</hi> unleſs they are <hi>out wardly</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: for <hi>heavy</hi> bodies cannot chuſe but <hi>deſcend, fire</hi> cannot chuſe but <hi>burn,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond ſtand the <hi>Senſitive</hi> creatures, four-footed <hi>beaſts,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">2.</note> 
                     <hi>fouls,</hi> and <hi>fiſhes;</hi> to theſe God hath given <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> to diſcern what is good for their <hi>nature,</hi> and what is bad; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt diverſe goods to prefer that which is beſt. He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them alſo a <hi>free appetite</hi> or a kind of <hi>ſenſitive will,</hi> by which they may either <hi>

A <hi>ſtone</hi> cannot chooſe but deſcend, but a <hi>beast</hi> may as well go up hill as down, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the upper Forme are <hi>Men,</hi> reaſonable Creatures, whom God hath made more <hi>volun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>freedom</hi> of choice, and preſenting unto their more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated knowledge a great <hi>variety</hi> of objects. Now then, without doubt, God diſtinguiſhed thus his creatures in <hi>abilities</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> that they might <hi>operate</hi> in their ſeveral <hi>kinds,</hi> that the <hi>natural</hi> agents might work <hi>naturally,</hi> the <hi>voluntary voluntarily,</hi> as that eloquent French-man <hi>Du Vain</hi> hath well explained this point. The truth of all this no man will deny <hi>explicitely:</hi> Well then, let them hearken to the conſequences of this truth, ſo common both in <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> among thoſe who handle of <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> cauſes. If God hath <hi>decreed</hi> that many things ſhould be done <hi>voluntarily</hi> by his creatures,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58106:139"/> then alſo hath he decreed that many things ſhould be done <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently,</hi> in reſpect of him; but the firſt is granted truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſecond ſhould be. The connexion I prove thus. All things are done <hi>contingently</hi> in reſpect of God, which for ought he hath decreed might with as much <hi>poſſibility</hi> not be as be: But all things which are done by the crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This Argument both confirms and explains our Opinion, ſhewing how and why many things come to paſs <hi>contingently</hi> in reſpect of God; yea, it maketh it queſtionleſs, that God hath decreed that many things ſhould be done <hi>contingently,</hi> or after ſuch a <hi>reſiſtable</hi> manner, that they might without <hi>fruſtrating</hi> His decree have been <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>See again the inconveniencies of the former opinion, which confoundeth all ſorts of creatures, and makes a <hi>man</hi> to operate with no more <hi>freedom</hi> than a <hi>ſtock</hi> or <hi>ſtone.</hi> For according to our Oppoſites, I eat, or drink, or walk with as much <hi>neceſſity,</hi> as <hi>Lead</hi> ſinketh down. God hath decreed that that ſhould ſink, and therefore it muſt; and ſo God hath <hi>decreed</hi> that I muſt walk a <hi>mile,</hi> and therefore I muſt.</p>
                  <p>Here they have a ſtarting hole, but it is ſo poor a one, that it doth not relieve but diſgrace them. They ſay, That Gods <hi>decree</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Evaſion.</note> doth not <hi>compel</hi> any mans <hi>will</hi> to any thing, that he ſhould do ſuch a thing whether he will or no; but he ſo diſpoſeth and worketh it, that it ſhall deſire that which God would have done.

                  <p>This <hi>ſlim-ſlam</hi> would move any mans patience, but I will be ſerious. The prerogative of a <hi>voluntary</hi> Agent conſiſteth not <note place="margin">Confutation.</note> in doing that which it deſireth to do, or rather in deſiring to do that which it doth, (for according to them, man deſireth

                  <p>In <hi>events</hi> there is a great difference between <hi>Contingency</hi> and <hi>Caſuality</hi> of events in reſpect of men; for moſt things we do, we do <hi>contingently,</hi> we being not bound by any <hi>inevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity</hi> to do them; yet as long as we do them upon certain <hi>perſuaſive</hi> reaſons, for certain <hi>ends,</hi> we do them not by <hi>chance.</hi> The ſame <hi>events</hi> yet are not after the ſame manner <hi>contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> in reſpect of God, as they are in reſpect of us; for He out of the Prerogative of His <hi>Deity</hi> fore-knoweth them; but we, by reaſon of our <hi>mortality,</hi> cannot have <hi>infallible</hi> foreſight of them; and what <hi>foreſight</hi> we have, is in a very little diſtance.</p>

                  <p>And here our <hi>Oppoſites</hi> may pleaſe to obſerve, how our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is ſo far from denying <hi>particular</hi> Providence, that it onely maintaineth a Providence <hi>properly</hi> termed <hi>Particular:</hi> for that <hi>particular</hi> Providence which our Oppoſites ſo much talk of, if it be well looked into, will appear to be in no better ſenſe <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> than the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is <hi>univerſal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſay, That there is not any <hi>numerical</hi> act performed by any creature, without an <hi>eternal</hi> decree from God; this they call <hi>particular</hi> providence. Alas! this is the <hi>general</hi> which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the actions performed by all things, or at leaſt one mixt of <hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular.</hi> As for example, Becauſe it raineth to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58106:142"/> day, God ſo ordering that it ſhould, is it any ſenſe to ſay, This rain was by the <hi>particular</hi> providence of God, unleſſe we eſpied <hi>extraordinary</hi> matter in it? We therefore call that <hi>univerſal</hi> providence, whereby God directeth whatſoever His creatures do, according to their <hi>natural</hi> propenſions, for the preſervation and good of the <hi>Univerſe.</hi> We term that <hi>particular</hi> or <hi>ſpeciall</hi> providence, whereby God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his <hi>extraordinary</hi> power amongſt the <hi>contingent</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> or <hi>private</hi> men, ſometimes by ſenſible <hi>miracles</hi> and <hi>prodigies,</hi> ſometimes by His <hi>ſecret</hi> om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, ſenſible onely in the <hi>Event,</hi> manifeſteth His <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to His own <hi>Glory,</hi> or good of His <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is properly termed <hi>ſpecial</hi> providence, and in this ſenſe it is taken by <hi>La Voſino</hi> the <hi>Italian,</hi> in his <hi>Tract, De par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulari Providentiâ;</hi> and by thoſe who have wrote of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

                  <p n="2">2. The petty conſequences of the <hi>main</hi> actions of <hi>natural</hi> Agents: for example, though the main drift and ſcope of the operations of the <hi>Elements</hi> and <hi>Meteors</hi> be according to the method <hi>eternally</hi> preſcribed them by God; yet ſome <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> events accompanying their operations, ſome <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> queſtionleſs were not prefixed by a <hi>particular</hi> decree; as now and then it hapneth to rain when the Sun ſhineth, I cannot believe that there's any <hi>ſpecial</hi> decree concerning this.</p>
                  <p>Hear I would have the Reader obſerve how theſe <hi>events</hi> are not ſo properly called <hi>contingent,</hi> as thoſe other are; for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58106:143"/> they were ſwayed by no <hi>decree</hi> either <hi>general</hi> or <hi>ſpecial,</hi> from the middle point between <hi>neceſsity</hi> and <hi>impoſsibility</hi> of being.

                  <p>I believe, that things of greateſt moment are done <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,</hi> by the <hi>immediate</hi> power of God, either by <hi>ſwaying</hi> men <note place="margin">2ly.</note> from their own proper inclinations, or by <hi>ſupernatural</hi> means quite croſſing their enterpriſes.

                  <p>I believe that the middle ſort of events in the world, ſuch as are neither <hi>trivial</hi> nor yet <hi>extraordinary,</hi> the <hi>ordinary</hi> ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">3ly.</note> matters which concern <hi>Religion, Common-wealths,</hi> the <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> good of private men, the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from confuſion, &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>This is one of the Arguments which proveth more than our Adverſaries would have them, and by theſe Rules have I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> in the ſecond Argument proved, that they make God <hi>the Author of ſin;</hi> for if <hi>cauſa cauſae</hi> be <hi>cauſa cauſati</hi> (as doubtleſs it is) while they make God the cauſe of all thoſe <hi>actions,</hi> which either are <hi>ſins,</hi> or the <hi>cauſes</hi> of <hi>ſins,</hi> queſtionleſs they make God (according to their own Argumentation) the <hi>cauſe of ſins.</hi> But they have a limitation for this Rule, and ſay, that it holdeth <hi>in cauſis eſſentialiter ſubordinatis,</hi> as they ſay, that God is the cauſe of all thoſe things which are <hi>eſſentially and diſtrictly</hi> done by our wills; but ſins proceeding from the <hi>depravation</hi> of our wills, are effects of a cauſe, not <hi>directly</hi> ſubordinate to God.

                     </gap>, the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it ſelf quite ſpoileth them: For 1. While <hi>Adam</hi>'s will was yet ſound, they teach, that God decreed that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould <hi>eat the forbidden fruit;</hi> now at that time they cannot ſay, but that <hi>Adam</hi> was a cauſe <hi>eſſentially ſubordinate</hi> to God. 2. They teach, that God is a <hi>cauſe</hi> not onely of our <hi>actions,</hi> but alſo of our <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions,</hi> as I may ſay; then <hi>theſe</hi> being the cauſes of our ſins, are directly <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us conſider not onely the <hi>ſubordination</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>wills,</hi> but alſo between our <hi>actions</hi> and their <hi>moralities,</hi> and we ſhall perceive, that according to the <hi>abuſe</hi> of theſe Rules, they make God the cauſe of our ſins. For that Rule, <hi>Cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati,</hi> is infallibly true expounded thus, <hi>The cauſe of any effect, is the cauſe of all ſuch events as neceſſarily follow that effect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then, if (as they ſay) God be a <hi>neceſſary</hi> cauſe of all our <hi>particular</hi> actions, ſeeing our <hi>actions</hi> in reference to ſuch and ſuch <hi>objects</hi> muſt needs be <hi>ſinful,</hi> it is manifeſt what followeth. For example: Though to take money in <hi>general</hi> be no ſin, yet to take <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> money, being none of our <hi>own,</hi> is a ſin. Now then, if God be a <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>this</hi> action in reference to <hi>this</hi> object (as he is if he be the cauſe of this <hi>particular</hi> action) it is impoſſible their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58106:146"/> Doctrine ſhould excuſe God from ſin. <hi>Eating,</hi> in reference to the <hi>forbidden</hi> fruit, was a <hi>ſin;</hi> but according to them, God was a <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal</hi> cauſe of eating the <hi>forbidden fruit. Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Minor prob.</hi> They ſay he was the <hi>neceſſitating</hi> cauſe of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular action.</p>
                  <p>Eating was a <hi>natural</hi> action, the <hi>individuation</hi> of this eating by an <hi>unlawful</hi> object was a <hi>moral</hi> obliquity.</p>
                  <p>But God was the cauſe of this <hi>individual. Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like may be ſaid of all our <hi>ſinful actions. When I have drunk ſufficiently both for the neceſſity and comfort of nature, to drink a cup more is ſin.</hi> But our Oppoſites teach, that I cannot take up this ſuperfluous cup without Gods <hi>ſpeciall</hi> determination: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Doctrine is enough to make ones hair ſtand an end, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God (whatſoever they ſay) the <hi>cauſe</hi> not onely of our <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but alſo of our <hi>obliquities:</hi> for what are the <hi>obliquities</hi> of our <hi>actions,</hi> but the placing of them upon wrong <hi>objects?</hi> If therefore they make God the <hi>principal</hi> cauſe of all our <hi>particular</hi> actions, moſt of which are particularized by bad objects) what do theſe men make of God? But Recrimination is no anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have ſhewed (though perhaps without method, yet, I hope, not without profit) how our Oppoſites are wounded with their own weapons. Now I will take their weapons out of their hands, and teach them the right uſe of them, ſhewing how God is the <hi>cauſe of all things,</hi> onely not the cauſe of <hi>ſin:</hi> a cauſe of all good things, yet ſo as that many good things are <hi>contingent</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>We have ſhewed in the third Argument how God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all ſorts of <hi>Inferior</hi> or <hi>ſecond cauſes</hi> ſhould work accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their proper kinds; that <hi>voluntary</hi> Agents ſhould work <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,</hi> &amp;c. God then is the <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> that all things do work and that they do work in certain kinds: If ſo, then God is the cauſe that many things are done <hi>contingently,</hi> one of the chiefeſt ſorts of ſecond cauſes by this appointment working <hi>voluntarily,</hi> and therefore <hi>contingently,</hi> which connexion we have formerly juſtified. This being well underſtood, will inſtruct us not onely that it may be ſo, but alſo that it muſt be ſo. That God being the <hi>neceſſary cauſe</hi> of all good things, yet all ſuch things are not <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary effects</hi> of Him. For example, It is impoſſible that man ſhould do any thing without God, therefore God is a cauſe <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:58106:146"/> to the being of all things effected by him; yet becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things done by the <hi>free choice</hi> of man, might as well have been omitted (God no ways conſtraining him to them) theſe are not <hi>neceſſary effects</hi> of God. The Reaſon of this is, becauſe God hath decreed that man ſhould work <hi>voluntarily,</hi> having liberty to do as well one thing as another, yet ſo that God giveth him the <hi>ſtrength</hi> to do whatſoever he <hi>chooſeth</hi> to do, and <hi>ability</hi> to <hi>chooſe</hi> what he will without limitation of his choice, (for this were elſe) <note place="margin">☜</note> to take it away, and to make man an <hi>involuntary</hi> Agent.) For example, God hath given thee <hi>ſtrength</hi> of body; he hath given thee alſo <hi>ability to chooſe</hi> in what exerciſe thou wilt employ it; thou chooſeſt to <hi>Ring</hi> or <hi>Dance;</hi> God then the Author of thy ſtrength is the <hi>chief</hi> cauſe of theſe exerciſes, yet ſo, as they are <hi>contingent</hi> in reſpect of Him, becauſe thou mighteſt have omitted them hadſt thou pleaſed. By this we may plainly ſee, how God is the <hi>principal cauſe</hi> of all things of which he is <hi>capable</hi> to be a cauſe; and yet many things are <hi>contingent</hi> in reſpect of him. This being cleared, we may with more facility conceive, how and in what ſenſe God is the cauſe of all we do, and yet we onely the cauſe of ſin.</p>
                  <p>God ſuſtains us when we are about our ſins; even then, <hi>in Him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> as well as when we are better buſied. God giveth that <hi>ſtrength</hi> by which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſin, yet becauſe he doth not <hi>neceſſitate</hi> or <hi>incline</hi> unto it, but we of our ſelves <hi>abuſe</hi> it to wickedneſs, God hath ſtill the part of a <hi>Creator,</hi> we onely are <hi>ſinful.</hi> An example will make this clear, Suppoſe a King delivereth to his Subject <hi>Men, Weapons, Mony,</hi> and <hi>Warlike proviſion,</hi> that he may fight for his Honor againſt his enemies; his Subject proves a <hi>Traitor,</hi> and uſeth all his <hi>Soveraigns</hi> ſtrength againſt himſelf. His Soveraign here is a <hi>cauſe</hi> that he hath the <hi>command,</hi> and doth the <hi>Office</hi> of a Captain, but he is no cauſe of his <hi>Treachery,</hi> the <hi>offence</hi> is onely the <hi>Captains,</hi> and the <hi>wrong</hi> is onely the <hi>Soveraigns.</hi> This is juſt the caſe between God and us; God hath given us many excellent <hi>faculties</hi> both of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul,</hi> which he <hi>intended</hi> we ſhould uſe to his <hi>Glory,</hi> in obedience to his commandements, and <hi>reſiſt</hi> His and our enemy the Devil; we moſt <hi>traiterouſly</hi> ſiding with <hi>Satan,</hi> have <hi>abuſed</hi> His gifts to His Diſhonor; God did the part of a <hi>Creator,</hi> we of <hi>Rebels.</hi> A man lives <hi>intemperately,</hi> God gave him not ſtrength
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58106:147"/> to this purpoſe, he <hi>neceſſitated</hi> not the man to this intemperancy: Man therefore onely ſinned, God is diſhonoured. The King made his Subject <hi>able</hi> to rebel againſt him, by delivering his <hi>military</hi> furniture unto him, the verier <hi>miſcreant</hi> he that did rebell againſt him. So God made <hi>Adam</hi> indeed <hi>able</hi> to ſin, but he never <hi>intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> that he ſhould ſin with that ability. God then is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of all thoſe things in which we ſin, and yet whatſoever he doth is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good; he is not the <hi>cauſe</hi> that we <hi>intend</hi> any ſin, but the <hi>cauſe</hi> that we are <hi>able</hi> to commit thoſe ſins we intend; and yet he <hi>intended</hi> not our abilities for ſin, but for his Service. Of all our good actions he is the <hi>firſt</hi> cauſe, we are the <hi>ſecond:</hi> of all our ſins we are the <hi>proper</hi> cauſe, he is onely the <hi>Conditio ſine qui non.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here ſome man may ſay, That <hi>choice</hi> or <hi>election</hi> of an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> object (upon which we miſplace our actions) is that which maketh us ſinners; now this being an act of our <hi>will,</hi> it muſt ſuppoſe alſo the <hi>concourſe</hi> of God; how then doth our opinion clear the point? The ſame Anſwer abundantly ſufficeth; God made <hi>Adam</hi> able to be <hi>willing</hi> to ſin, but he made him not to <hi>will</hi> ſin: God ſet before him <hi>life and death,</hi> that he did <hi>chooſe</hi> death it was by the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of will given him of God; but God did not <hi>bind</hi> him to <hi>chooſe</hi> death, for that were (a <hi>contradiction</hi>) a <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated</hi> choice.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, whatſoever we chooſe, we do it by the power by which we are <hi>voluntary Agents,</hi> yet if we chooſe death, God is <note place="margin" type="runSum">Object. ult.</note> not to be blamed, (for he made us <hi>voluntary</hi>) and therefore it was as <hi>poſſible</hi> for us to have <hi>choſen</hi> life. If the nature of a <hi>voluntary</hi> Agent be well obſerved, this point will be moſt evident.</p>
                  <p>The laſt objection is this, Gods <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> of all <hi>futures</hi> is moſt <hi>infallible</hi> and <hi>neceſſary: Ergo,</hi> All <hi>futures</hi> in reſpect of him fall out <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> otherwiſe it is poſſible God may be <hi>deceived;</hi> yea, if many things fall out <hi>contingently,</hi> Gods <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> of them can be but <hi>contingent,</hi> depending after a ſort on mans <hi>free-will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Argument is <hi>plauſible</hi> at the firſt view, but if it be touched it falls to ſhatters. It is one thing to know that a thing will <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be done,</hi> and another to <hi>know neceſſarily</hi> that a thing will be done. God doth <hi>neceſſarily and certainly foreknow</hi> all that will be done, but he doth not know that thoſe things which ſhall be done <hi>voluntarily</hi> will be done <hi>neceſſarily:</hi> he knoweth that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58106:147"/> they will be done, but he knoweth withall, that they might have fallen out otherwiſe, for ought he had ordered to the contrary. So God <hi>neceſſarily</hi> knew that <hi>Adam</hi> would fall, and yet he knew that he would not fall <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> for it was as poſſible for him not to have fallen. It was the <hi>antient</hi> (and is ſtill the true) opinion, That Gods <hi>Praeſcience</hi> is not the cauſe of <hi>Events;</hi> he <hi>fore-knoweth</hi> all things becauſe they will be done, things are not done becauſe he <hi>fore-knoweth</hi> them. The <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of his knowledge conſiſteth not in the <hi>immutability</hi> of his <hi>decree,</hi> but in the <hi>prerogative</hi> of his <hi>Deity;</hi> it is impoſſible therefore that any man by his <hi>voluntary</hi> manner of working ſhould <hi>delude</hi> Gods <hi>fore-ſight;</hi> not becauſe God doth <hi>neceſſitate</hi> his will to <hi>certain effects,</hi> (for this were indeed to take it away) but becauſe his <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> is <hi>infinite.</hi>
